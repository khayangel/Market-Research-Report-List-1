<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Lithotriptors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Use</li><li>Reusable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical lithotriptors are medical devices used for the fragmentation of kidney or bladder stones. The market for these lithotriptors can be categorized into two types: single use and reusable. Single use lithotriptors are designed for one-time use and are disposed of after each procedure, ensuring minimal risk of cross-contamination. Reusable lithotriptors, on the other hand, can be sterilized and used multiple times, making them a cost-effective option. Both types offer efficient stone fragmentation but differ in terms of cost and infection control protocols.</p></p>
