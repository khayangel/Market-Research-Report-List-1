<p><strong>The Fire Sprinkler Pipes and Fittings Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Fire Sprinkler System</li><li>Dry Fire Sprinkler System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire sprinkler pipes and fittings market is driven by the application of wet and dry fire sprinkler systems. Wet fire sprinkler systems utilize constantly pressurized water in the pipes, ready to be released upon detection of a fire, ensuring immediate and effective fire suppression. On the other hand, dry fire sprinkler systems utilize pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipes, which is released first when a fire occurs, allowing water to flow thereafter. These systems are vital in protecting properties and saving lives in the event of a fire.</p></p>
