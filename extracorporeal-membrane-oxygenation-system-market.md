<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Veno-Arterial (VA)</li><li>Veno-Venous (VV)</li><li>Arterio-Venous (AV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation System market comprises three main types: Veno-Arterial (VA), Veno-Venous (VV), and Arterio-Venous (AV). VA ECMO provides both cardiac and pulmonary support by withdrawing deoxygenated blood from a vein and returning oxygenated blood to an artery. VV ECMO eliminates the need for cardiac support, as it solely focuses on pulmonary assistance by removing blood from a vein and returning oxygenated blood to another vein. AV ECMO facilitates oxygenation of the blood without bypassing the heart, utilizing two cannulas inserted into an artery and a vein.</p></p>
