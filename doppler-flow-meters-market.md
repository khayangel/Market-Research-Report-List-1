<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Doppler Flow Meters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-sensor Doppler Flow Meters</li><li>Two-sensor Doppler Flow Meters</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Doppler Flow Meters are devices used to measure the flow velocity of liquids or gases. There are two main types of Doppler Flow Meters - one-sensor and two-sensor Doppler Flow Meters. One-sensor Doppler Flow Meters use a single transducer to emit and receive ultrasonic signals, measuring the flow velocity based on the Doppler effect. On the other hand, two-sensor Doppler Flow Meters employ two transducers, one for transmitting and the other for receiving signals. This design provides improved accuracy and allows for measuring bidirectional flow.</p></p>
