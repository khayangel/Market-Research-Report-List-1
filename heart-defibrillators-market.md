<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator</li><li>External Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heart defibrillators are devices used to treat abnormal heart rhythms and prevent sudden cardiac arrest. There are two main types of heart defibrillators: implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and external defibrillators. ICDs are surgically implanted in the chest and continuously monitor the heart's rhythm, delivering electric shocks whenever abnormal rhythms are detected. External defibrillators, on the other hand, are portable devices used by medical professionals or trained individuals to administer electric shocks externally to restore normal heart rhythms. Both types play a crucial role in saving lives by delivering timely shocks to the heart when needed.</p></p>
