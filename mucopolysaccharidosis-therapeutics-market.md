<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mucopolysaccharidosis Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous</li><li>Intracerebroventricular (ICV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) therapeutics market includes different types of treatments. Intravenous therapy involves administering drugs through a vein, allowing for systemic distribution throughout the body. This method aims to alleviate symptoms and slow disease progression. On the other hand, intracerebroventricular (ICV) therapy involves delivering drugs directly into the fluid-filled spaces of the brain, targeting the central nervous system and treating neurological symptoms more effectively. Both approaches have their own benefits, and their use depends on the specific needs and conditions of the MPS patient.</p></p>
