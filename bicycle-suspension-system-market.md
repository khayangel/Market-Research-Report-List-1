<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bicycle Suspension System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hardtail Suspension</li><li>Full Suspension</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The bicycle suspension system market consists of two types: hardtail suspension and full suspension. Hardtail suspension refers to bicycles that only have front suspension, meaning the fork absorbs shocks while the rear wheel remains stiff. On the other hand, full suspension bicycles have both front and rear suspension, allowing both wheels to absorb shocks, providing a smoother and more comfortable ride. Both types cater to different needs, with hardtail suspension offering simplicity and efficiency, while full suspension provides enhanced control and comfort on rough terrains.</p></p>
