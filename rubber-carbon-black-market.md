<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubber Carbon Black Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Black</li><li>Furnace Black</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rubber Carbon Black is a vital material used in rubber products to enhance their durability and strength. There are two types of Rubber Carbon Black: Thermal Black and Furnace Black. Thermal Black is produced by decomposing natural gas in a controlled environment, resulting in high purity and small particle size carbon black. Furnace Black, on the other hand, is made by burning heavy oils or petroleum residues, leading to larger particle size carbon black with lower purity. Both types have specific applications in the rubber industry, depending on desired properties and performance requirements.</p></p>
