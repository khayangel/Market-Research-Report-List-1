<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dense RDF</li><li>Loose RDF</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) is a type of fuel that is produced from the processing of municipal solid waste (MSW). The RDF market has two main types: Dense RDF and Loose RDF. Dense RDF is characterized by highly compacted waste materials, usually formed into pellets or briquettes, which have a higher energy content and are more suitable for long-distance transport and storage. In contrast, Loose RDF refers to less compacted waste materials, like shredded or fluffed MSW, which are often used for local or on-site energy generation due to their lower energy density.</p></p>
