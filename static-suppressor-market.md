<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Static Suppressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spray Type</li><li>Electronic Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The static suppressor market comprises two main types: spray type and electronic type. Spray type static suppressors function by spraying a thin layer of anti-static coating onto surfaces, reducing static electricity buildup. This type is commonly used on materials like plastics and textiles. Conversely, electronic type static suppressors employ electronic components to neutralize static charges, typically through ionization or grounding. This type is commonly used in electronic devices or areas where sensitive equipment is present. Both types aim to decrease the risk of static electricity-related damage and improve overall safety.</p></p>
