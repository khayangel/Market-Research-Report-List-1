<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acute Intermittent Porphyria Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analogues</li><li>Prophylactic Hematin Infusions</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of heme, a vital molecule involved in oxygen transportation. The market for AIP treatment includes two types: Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Analogues and Prophylactic Hematin Infusions. GnRH Analogues are medications that help regulate hormonal imbalances associated with AIP, reducing symptoms and frequency of attacks. Prophylactic Hematin Infusions involve injections of heme-like substances to prevent the accumulation of toxic porphyrin precursors, thereby managing the symptoms and preventing acute attacks. Both approaches aim to improve the quality of life for AIP patients.</p></p>
