<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drive in Rack Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Entry Racks</li><li>Double Entry Racks</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Drive-in racks are a type of storage system commonly used in warehouses and distribution centers. Single entry racks have a single aisle, allowing forklifts to access one side to load and unload pallets. This design maximizes storage capacity but restricts access to the last pallets placed. On the other hand, double entry racks have aisles on both sides, allowing forklifts to access from either direction. Though it reduces storage density, double entry racks provide easier access to all pallets, enhancing efficiency in inventory management.</p></p>
