<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Process Flares Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elevated Torch</li><li>Surface Torch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Process flares are used in industrial settings to burn off excess gases in a safe and controlled manner. Elevated torches are mounted on tall structures to safely burn off gases at a higher elevation, reducing the impact of noise and emissions on surrounding areas. Surface torches, on the other hand, are installed directly at ground level and are typically used for smaller-scale applications. Both types of flares serve the same purpose of safely disposing of unwanted gases while minimizing impact on the environment and surrounding communities.</p></p>
