<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extractive CEMS</li><li>In-Situ CEMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS) are used to measure and monitor air emissions from industrial sources. There are two main types of CEMS: extractive CEMS and in-situ CEMS. </p><p>Extractive CEMS involve the extraction of a sample gas from the emission source, which is then transported to an analyzer for measurement. This method is commonly used for high temperature or high moisture applications. </p><p>In-situ CEMS, on the other hand, directly measure emissions within the stack or duct using sensors. This method eliminates the need for sample extraction and is more suitable for low temperature or low-moisture applications. Both types of CEMS play a crucial role in monitoring and ensuring compliance with emission regulations.</p></p>
