<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NB-IoT Chipset Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standalone</li><li>In-Band</li><li>Guard Band</li></ul></p>
<p><p>NB-IoT chipsets are available in three market types: Standalone, In-Band, and Guard Band. Standalone chipsets operate independently and have their own frequency bands. In-Band chipsets share frequency bands with existing LTE networks, allowing for more efficient use of resources. Guard Band chipsets use unused spectrum between LTE bands to transmit NB-IoT signals without interfering with existing networks. Each market type offers different benefits and trade-offs in terms of frequency usage, compatibility, and network efficiency.</p></p>
