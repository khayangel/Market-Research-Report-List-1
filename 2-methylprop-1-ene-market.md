<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 2-methylprop-1-ene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>MTBE Cracking</li><li>Tert-butanol (TBA)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 2-methylprop-1-ene market is mainly divided into two types - MTBE cracking and Tert-butanol (TBA) market. In the MTBE cracking market, 2-methylprop-1-ene is utilized as a feedstock for the production of high-octane gasoline. This process involves the cracking of MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) to extract isobutylene (2-methylprop-1-ene). On the other hand, the Tert-butanol (TBA) market involves the production of TBA through the hydration of 2-methylprop-1-ene. TBA is commonly used as an additive in gasoline and as a precursor for the production of methyl methacrylate and isobutylene.</p></p>
