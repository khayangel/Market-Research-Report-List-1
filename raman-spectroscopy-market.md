<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Raman Spectroscopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Immersion Mode</li><li>Stand-off Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Raman spectroscopy is a technique used for analyzing chemical compounds. In immersion mode, the sample is directly immersed into the Raman spectrometer, allowing for precise measurements and analysis. This mode is commonly used in pharmaceutical and biological applications. On the other hand, stand-off mode enables non-contact analysis, meaning the sample can be analyzed from a distance using laser beams. This mode is often utilized for hazardous or inaccessible samples, such as explosives or artworks. Both immersion and stand-off modes offer distinct advantages depending on the nature of the samples being analyzed.</p></p>
