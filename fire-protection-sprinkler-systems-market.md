<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Protection Sprinkler Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Active type fire protection sprinkler systems are designed to detect a fire and automatically activate sprinklers to suppress the flames. These systems rely on sensors, such as smoke or heat detectors, to trigger the sprinklers. Passive type fire protection sprinkler systems, on the other hand, are installed as a precautionary measure and do not require an activation mechanism. They are designed to contain the fire within a specific area, using fire-resistant materials, barriers, or fire doors. Both active and passive type systems aim to prevent the spread of fire and minimize damage to property and life.</p></p>
