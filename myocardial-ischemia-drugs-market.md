<p><p>The global market for myocardial ischemia drugs is anticipated to witness significant growth in the forecast period across various regions including North America, Asia-Pacific (APAC), Europe, the United States, and China. North America is projected to dominate the market owing to the presence of a well-established healthcare infrastructure, higher healthcare spending, and the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The region is expected to hold a substantial market share of around 40%. Following closely is Europe, with an estimated market share of 35%, driven by increasing awareness and government initiatives to prevent CVDs. The APAC region, particularly China, is expected to experience significant growth due to the large patient pool and improving healthcare infrastructure, holding a market share of approximately 15%. This growth can be attributed to rising disposable incomes and the adoption of a sedentary lifestyle leading to an increase in CVD cases. The United States market is expected to account for the remaining 10% market share, primarily driven by a rise in the aging population, increasing obesity rates, and the subsequent surge in CVD cases.</p></p>
