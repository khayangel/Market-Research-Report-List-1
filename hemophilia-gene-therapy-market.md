<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hemophilia Gene Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemophilia A</li><li>Hemophilia B</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Hemophilia Gene Therapy market refers to the market for treatments for Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B, both genetic disorders characterized by the body's inability to produce blood-clotting proteins. Hemophilia A is caused by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII, while Hemophilia B is caused by a deficiency of clotting factor IX. Gene therapy is a potential treatment approach that aims to introduce the missing clotting factor gene into the patient's body to enable their own cells to produce the clotting factor, thus reducing the frequency of bleeding episodes and improving the quality of life for hemophilia patients.</p></p>
