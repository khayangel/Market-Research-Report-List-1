<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boiler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fire-tube</li><li>Water-tube</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The boiler market is divided into two types: fire-tube and water-tube. In fire-tube boilers, hot gases produced by the combustion process flow through tubes surrounded by water, transferring heat to the water to produce steam. Water-tube boilers, on the other hand, have water-filled tubes which are heated externally by hot gases. The heat transfer occurs through the tubes, generating steam. Fire-tube boilers are commonly used for low-pressure applications, while water-tube boilers are preferred for high-pressure and high-temperature applications due to their greater efficiency and safety.</p></p>
