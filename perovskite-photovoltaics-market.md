<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Perovskite Photovoltaics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Structure</li><li>Inverted Structure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Perovskite photovoltaics are a type of solar cell that use perovskite materials to convert sunlight into electricity. There are two common structures used in these solar cells: normal structure and inverted structure. In the normal structure, the perovskite layer is sandwiched between the electron and hole transport layers. In the inverted structure, the order is reversed, with the perovskite layer on top of the electron transport layer. Both types have advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency, stability, and fabrication processes, and are being researched and developed for commercial application in the solar photovoltaic market.</p></p>
