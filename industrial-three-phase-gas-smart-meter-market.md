<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Three Phase Gas Smart Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IC Card</li><li>Non-IC Card</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Industrial three-phase gas smart meters are used in monitoring and measuring gas consumption in industrial settings. There are two types of markets for these meters: IC card and non-IC card. IC card meters are equipped with a smart card that stores information about gas usage and can be inserted into the meter for data transfer and recharging. Non-IC card meters, on the other hand, do not use smart cards and rely on other means of data transfer and billing. Both types serve the same purpose but differ in their technological features.</p></p>
