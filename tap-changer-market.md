<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tap Changer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OLTC</li><li>DETC/NLTC/OCTC</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Tap changer is a device in power transformers that regulates the number of turns in the transformer winding, thereby adjusting the output voltage. There are different types of tap changers available in the market. On-Load Tap Changers (OLTC) are used for regulating transformer voltage while the transformer is in operation. Distribution Tap Changers (DETC), also known as No-Load Tap Changers (NLTC), are designed for regulation when the transformer is offline. Off-Circuit Tap Changers (OCTC) are used in small-scale transformers or those with low power ratings. These tap changers allow voltage adjustment by temporarily disconnecting the transformer from the system.</p></p>
